✅ **Direct Messaging Feature Added!**

I've successfully added the foundation for direct messaging:

### What's Been Implemented:
1. **Database Table**: Created `direct_messages` table with RLS policies for secure 1-on-1 messaging
2. **User Search Component**: Built a searchable interface to find and select members
3. **Direct Messaging Hook**: Created `useDirectMessages` hook for managing DM conversations

### How to Use (Once UI is Complete):
1. Click a "New Message" button to search for a member
2. Select someone from the search results  
3. Send private messages directly to that person
4. View all your DM conversations in a separate tab

### What's Next:
Would you like me to:
1. **Add the UI integration** - Add a "New Message" button and Direct Messages tab to the current messages panel
2. **Test it out** - Complete the full integration so you can start sending direct messages right away

The backend is ready - I just need to wire up the final UI pieces. Should I proceed with adding the complete user interface?
